# QL

QL is a command-line tool to preview files in [Quick Look](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_Look). It differs from `qlmanage -p` in that the window controls and title donâ€™t display debugging information, and there is no extraneous output information or an app launch visible in the Dock and Menu Bar, making it look and behave more like a real Quick Look trigger.

## Installation

Install with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```shell
brew install vitorgalvao/tiny-scripts/ql
```

Alternatively, download the executable in the releases and call it directly.

## Usage

```
Preview paths with Quick Look.

Usage: ql <path...>

Options:
  -h, --help   Show this help.
```
